3. Choose the scan number with "Numer skanu:" slider
4. Read the file
    - adjust the window width and center with appropriate sliders
    - Using ROI selection under "Zaznacz ROI" button, calculate all nessesary data and show number of grey pixels on the histogram
5. To change current open folder, start from point 2
